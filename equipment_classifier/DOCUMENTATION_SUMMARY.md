## Quick Start Summary 🎯

### **Primary Use Case: Industry Consultant Analysis**

**The Challenge:** Industry consultants receive client databases with thousands of work orders, but critical equipment classification data is missing or inconsistent. This makes maintenance cost analysis, failure pattern identification, and strategic asset management recommendations nearly impossible.

**The Solution:** This system reads equipment descriptions and automatically identifies:

- What type of equipment it is (AHU, elevator, pump, etc.)
- How confident it is in that identification (0-100%)
- Additional context (equipment IDs, work types, locations)

**The Result:** Consultants can quickly transform incomplete data into comprehensive asset management insights, enabling evidence-based recommendations for maintenance optimization, cost reduction, and strategic asset planning.

### **Example Input/Output**

```
INPUT: "AHU 4.13 preventive maintenance required"

OUTPUT:
- Equipment Type: Air Handling Unit (AHU)
- Confidence: 68%
- Equipment ID: AHU 4.13
- Work Type: Preventive Maintenance
- Industry Context: HVAC System
```

### **Supported Industries**

- **AIRPORT**: Terminals, baggage systems, security, HVAC
- **CHEMICAL**: Process equipment, safety systems, instrumentation
- **MANUFACTURING**: Production lines, material handling, quality control
- **WATER**: Treatment systems, pumping, monitoring equipment
- **GENERIC**: Basic building systems for any facility

### **File Formats Supported**

- Excel (.xlsx)
- CSV (.csv)
- Direct text input
- Batch processing
