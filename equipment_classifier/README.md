# Equipment Classifier

A modular NLP-based system for classifying equipment from work order descriptions across multiple industries.

## Features

- **Multi-Industry Support**: Airport, Chemical Processing, Manufacturing, Water/Wastewater
- **NLP Processing**: Advanced text preprocessing and pattern recognition
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability metrics for each classification
- **Claude Skill Ready**: Designed for integration with Claude Skills
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new industries and equipment types

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd equipment_classifier

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from equipment_classifier import EquipmentClassifier

# Initialize for airport industry
classifier = EquipmentClassifier(industry="AIRPORT")

# Classify equipment from description
result = classifier.classify("AHU 4.13 maintenance required")
print(f"Equipment: {result.equipment_type}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
```

## Claude Skill Integration

This classifier is designed as a stateless component that can be easily integrated into Claude Skills:

```python
# Simple classification interface
def classify_equipment(description: str, industry: str = "AIRPORT") -> dict:
    classifier = EquipmentClassifier(industry=industry)
    result = classifier.classify(description)
    return {
        "equipment_type": result.equipment_type,
        "confidence": result.confidence,
        "context": result.context
    }
```
