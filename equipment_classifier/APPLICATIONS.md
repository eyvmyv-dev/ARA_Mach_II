# What Can You Do With This System? Real-World Applications

## Primary Application: Evaluating Work Order and Failure Data

### **For Industry Consultants in Support of their Customers** üéØ

**Before:** The Industry Consultant needs to use guesswork and imprecise tools to classify equipment types. This can be very time-consuming drudgery that humans aren't really good at. Sometimes the data is in pretty good shape and not missing a whole lot of data. But in some cases, MOST of the data is missing, making the data almost unusable.

**After:** When the industry consultant has access to the customer's work order and failure history, the first step is to assess if these transactional records have the equipment classification value for each record. If not, the application will read through work orders, and based on the information on each work order make a confidence-rated guess about what equipment type is involved in this work order.

**This way, the consultant can decompose the data effectively separating the compressors and HVAC systems from signs and light switch covers.**

#### **Immediate Analysis Benefits:**

- **Equipment Cost Analysis:** Quickly identify which equipment types have the highest maintenance cost
- **Failure Pattern Recognition:** Analyze how many failures are occurring by equipment type
- **Work Priority Distribution:** Understand the distribution of work in terms of priority ranging from emergency work that needs to be done immediately to low-priority work that can be scheduled a month out or more
- **Cost/Failure Hotspots:** Zero in on the equipment types that are costing the most and/or failing the most and decide whether they are being over-maintained or under-maintained

#### **Strategic Asset Management:**

- **Planned vs. Corrective Work Ratio:** Assess the spend ratio between planned preventive work and the amount of corrective (failure) work and how corrective work maps to high priority reactive work
- **Asset Strategy Development:** Review and strengthen the asset strategies for these assets by assessing asset risk exposure and the dominant failure modes, define a protective strategy (FMEA or something like it)
- **Strategy Operationalization:** Operationalize the strategy and ensure that all the "switches are in the 'on' position" and that the strategy is being complied with
- **Maintenance Optimization:** Update the maintenance plan, task lists, procedures, materials and kitting so that we are neither over-maintaining nor under-maintaining those assets

#### **Technology Integration:**

- **Sensor Selection:** Select sensors and data tags that can be connected to the operationalized strategy - like how humans use an Apple Watch - to verify that the conditions that need to be monitored, as prescribed by the strategy, are being monitored with the appropriate threshold limits and triggers
- **Investment Planning:** Document all of the costs associated with the investment needed to be made for this protective strategy (BUDGET)
- **Cost Tracking:** Ensure the business process enforces work order settlement and close out that collects all the necessary cost of parts, labor, and materials (ACTUAL)

#### **Performance Improvements:**

**Operational Level:**
The intent is to help the operational level of the organization to continually compound its collective understanding of the "care, feeding, and performance" of its essential (critical) assets making sure the system gives us the visibility to safely maximize, predictable production, at the lowest sustainable cost, while observing the changing risk profile of the business.

**Strategic Level:**
At the strategic level of the organization, the improvement in asset management system performance should be aligned and consistent with organizational objectives and financial performance metrics.

## Supporting Applications: Daily Operations

### **For Maintenance Managers** üëî

**Before:** Sarah spends 2 hours every morning sorting through 50+ work orders, trying to figure out what equipment each one is about so she can assign them to the right technicians.

**After:** Sarah uploads her work orders and gets instant results:

- 35 HVAC-related issues ‚Üí Assign to HVAC team
- 8 Elevator problems ‚Üí Assign to elevator contractor
- 4 Security equipment issues ‚Üí Assign to security systems team

### **For Facility Directors** üè¢

**Before:** Jim has to manually create reports about equipment problems. He never knows if they're missing patterns or trends.

**After:** Jim gets automatic insights:

- "You have 40% more chiller problems this month than usual"
- "Elevator maintenance requests spike every Friday"
- "Terminal 2 has twice as many HVAC issues as Terminal 1"
- "Security equipment failures increased 25% after the software update"

### **For Technicians** üîß

**Before:** Mike gets a work order that says "Something broken in Room 205" and has to guess what tools to bring.
